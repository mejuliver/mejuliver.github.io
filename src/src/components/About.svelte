							<p class="mb16">A full-stack web developer with almost 8 years of experience, I have a diverse set of skills ranging from Nodejs, SASS, Javascript, VueJS, Nuxt, Svelte, Electron wordpress, all the way to Cordova, LAMP, Laravel, Lumen, Codeigniter, RethinkDB, MongoDB, custom development ready for you. I’m a team player and enthusiastic on both the frontend and backend and always on discovering and learning new and cutting edge development tools and languages. I am passionate about being a web developer. I find it really easy to get involved in the projects I work on. You get into the system, find a way to build it/change it/fix it, and then release it to whoever needs it. It’s a fun cycle.</p>
